## What is Dual N Back?
Dual N Back is an application that was originally designed by psychologist Susanne Jaeggi in 2003. The game requires the player to watch a series of flashing spaces on a grid, while simultaneously listening to a series of sounds. The player must match the current grid space and the current sound with the grid space and sound n iterations back in the sequence. The game tests and builds working memory.
